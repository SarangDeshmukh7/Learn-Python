'''
In the game of Hangman, a 
clue word is given by the program that the player has to 
guess, letter by letter. The player guesses one letter at a 
time until the entire word has been guessed. (In the actual 
game, the player can only guess 6 letters incorrectly before 
losing).
Let’s say the word the player has to guess is “EVAPORATE”.
For this exercise, write the logic that asks a player to guess
a letter and displays letters in the clue word that were 
guessed correctly. For now, let the player guess an infinite
number of times until they get the entire word. As a bonus,
keep track of the letters the player guessed and display a 
different message if the player tries to guess that letter
again. Remember to stop the game when all the letters have 
been guessed correctly! Don’t worry about choosing a word
randomly or keeping track of the number of guesses the player
has remaining - we will deal with those in a future exercise.
An example interaction can look like this:
>>> Welcome to Hangman!
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
>>> Guess your letter: S
Incorrect!
>>> Guess your letter: E
E _ _ _ _ _ _ _ E
...
And so on, until the player gets the word.
